        <p>In this article series, I'm trying to build a working equatorial mount for a 10" Dobsonian telescope.</p>

    First article:
    - Topic: how to construct gears?
    - Made better motor script, which averages a rotation every 8.6164s.
    - This led to having simpler gear ratios, just 4 x 1:10 --> 1:10000 --> 86164s.
    - Was looking for easy ways to design gear ratios, found http://woodgears.ca/gear_cutting/template.html,
      forked it into repo so it could be converted into SVG
    - Sent .ai file to lasercutstudio.com, they cut (also include .ai file here)
    - Pictures of finished gears.

    Second article:
    - Topic: how to connect gears?
    - Bought threaded steel rod as axis from motonet, also bolts and washers.
    - Initially thought to glue one small and one big gear together, would not need separate axis for
      each gear pair (as the axis wouldn't be attached to the gears, all gear pairs could rotate
      autonomously from each other)
    - Didn't work as glue didn't stick into acrylic (tried pikaliima and kuumaliima)
    - *insert quote from Jobs about glued products being shit*
    - Decided to go the proper route = fastening gears with bolts and washers to the threaded rod to
      keep them in place.
    - This means tho that each gear pair would have their own axis, and the axis (threaded rod) would
      rotate instead of the gears.
    - Cut axis into 3 120mm pieces and 1 150mm piece (center axis which also connects to 3rd plywood)
    - First gear is at approx. height of 80mm, as it is attached to motor (include summary of this height)
    - 1st gearpair is small on bottom, large on top (large connects to small motor gear)
    - 2nd gearpair is large on bottom (connects to small gear of 1st pair), small on top.
      This step also had 2 bolts between gears (anyway include exact height configs for all gears, check at home)
    - 3rd gearpair is also large on bottom (connects to small gear of 2nd pair), small on top.
    - 4th gearpair only has large gear (connects to small gear of 3rd pair), as it is the final step.
    - Picture and video of final config rotating on cardboard.
