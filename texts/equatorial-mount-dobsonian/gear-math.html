        <p>In this article series, I'm trying to build a working equatorial mount for a 10" Dobsonian telescope.</p>

        <p>This is just a quick update post to talk about the mount's gear ratios.</p>
        <p>The mount has to rotate in sync with the Earth's rotation (albeit in the opposite direction
        to counteract it), so naturally I thought it would have to rotate once every 24 hours. But that sounds
        a bit too easy, doesn't it? I soon discovered, that instead of solar time, which we use in our daily
        lives, the mount has to rotate by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">sidereal time</a>.
        So instead of 24 hours, each rotation should last approximately 23h56min.</p>
        <p>That doesn't sound that different, until you start to do the math. 24 hours equates to a nice, round number, 86400 seconds
        (60s * 60min * 24h). 23h56min on the other hand, gives us 86164s. This becomes a problem as you start working
        with the mount's gear ratios.</p>
        <p>Assuming the motor is rotating at 1RPS (rotations per second), <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=factor+86400">according to WolframAlpha</a>
        we would need the gear ratios 1:2 (7 times), 1:3 (3 times) and 1:5 (2 times) to get 86400 (2^7*3^3*5^2=86400). Nice and even.
        But when we look at <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=factor+86164">the factors of 86164</a>, we get to the problem.
        One of the factors of 86164 is 1657, which is an insanely large gear ratio. Assuming a 1:2 gear in our mount would be
        5cm in diameter, a 1:1657 gear would have a diameter of 41.2m. Totally unfeasible.</p>
        <p>I almost decided to go with the 86400s rotation period and suffer the minor accuracy problems, but I wanted to give
        raw computing power a chance. So I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/aapokiiso/99da589d9c9592ec2cc7">a simple C script</a>,
        which takes a desired rotation period and the largest allowed gear ratio,
        and returns a number closest to the desired period with acceptable gear ratios.
        It is basically just a glorified least-factors calculator.</p>
        <p>I ran the script with the desired period of 86164 seconds, and a maximum gear ratio of 7,
        since that would give us a gear of 17.5cm in diameter, which is large but borderline acceptable.</p>
        <p>

                Frying-Pan:~ aapokiiso$ ./optimalfactors 86164 7
                2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7
                86016 (diff: -148)
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>86016 seconds! While it still has an error of over 2 minutes (148 seconds),
        it is 37.2% more accurate than the 236 seconds of error with 86400s. So I've decided
        to go with 86016 as the mount's rotation period.</p>
        <p>Here are some alternative option with different gear ratios:
