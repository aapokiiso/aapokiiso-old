        <p>In this article series, I'm trying to build a working equatorial mount for a 10" Dobsonian telescope.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <p>Last summer, I was browsing Reddit as I oftentimes do on a slow Saturday afternoon, when I stumbled upon
            <a href="//reddit.com/r/astrophotography">/r/astrophotography</a>. It was probably some bestof'd post that led me there (maybe
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/32o0lo/please_help_me_identify_this_for_lack_of_a_better/cqd1x7p">this one</a>),
        but nevertheless I found myself soon after browsing <a href="//reddit.com/r/astronomy">/r/astronomy</a> for tips on buying a telescope.</p>
        <p>When I get a (seemingly) great idea, I spend most of my waking time completely surrounding myself with it, until I face a setback and lose interest.
        Some years ago, I had a phase of absolute bonsai-mania. I read too many blog posts on growing those miniature trees, hung around on some
        obscure Finnish bonsai forum, and even attempted to grow a Sequoia tree from a seedling. When I noticed how slow
        everything was progressing, and when my Sequoia sapling surprisingly died in the snow (oops), I lost my interest almost as quickly as I had found it.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, I can say the same thing happened with my astronomy hobby last summer. I didn't research the subject enough, bought a telescope arguably too big for
        casual use, and when I didn't see the Hubble-y sights of distant galaxies and vibrant nebulae from our backyard, I gave up.</p>
        <p>Luckily, I had already invested enough money into the gear to feel that Sting of Bad Investment inside of me every time I saw the telescope sitting unused on our porch.
        I decided to restart my short-lived astronomy hobby, but I also decided to make a conscious effort to be patient and to control my greed for bigger and brighter views.</p>
