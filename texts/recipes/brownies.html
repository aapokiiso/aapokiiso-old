            A sweet brownie recipe built from other sweet brownie recipes.

            As is tradition with brownies, the result will make you say "no more" after the 2nd bite. It is very fatty and sugary, but oh so good.

            Units are based on Finnish customs, and might not be the easiest format just for you. 
            Consider this my little revenge from trying to grabble with cups and butter sticks.

            Heat the oven to 180C when you start. You should also find a square-ish 20x20cm baking dish and coat it
            with parchment paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Put some water boiling in a pot, and place your baking pot on top of it so that the steam licks the bottom your 
            baking pot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Melt the chocolate and butter in the pot placed over the boiling water, make sure to mix it evenly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mix the brown sugar with the melted chocolate-butter, again mix it evenly. Move the baking pot
            away from the steam to cool for a bit (you can stop boiling the water now).
        </p>

        <p>
            Combine the flour, cocoa powder, vanilla sugar and salt together in a separate pot.

        <p>
            After the chocolate-melt has cooled close to room temperature, you can add the eggs & yolk to the mix. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Shake the flour mix into the melt, and mix it evenly. It is important you don't over-do this though, as
            it will make the brownies cake-like. So stop mixing immediately after all white "flour-stripes" have been blended in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pour the chocolate chips into the mix. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Pour the brownie mix onto the parched baking dish, and distribute it evenly on the dish.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bake the brownies for 25-30 in the oven. You can consider your brownies done when a toothpick placed
            in the middle of the brownie dish comes out only with a few moist crumbles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once baked, let the brownies sit and cool for half an hour before serving. 
            Tastes best with some ice cream or a glass of milk!
